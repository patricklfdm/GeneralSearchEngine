# GeneralSearchEngine V5.x development line

- **Status:** Phase 0 candidate; protected-master acceptance pending
- **Stable comparison release:** GeneralSearchEngine `4.4.0`
- **Architecture boundary:** replicated single-shard search

V5.x builds one replicated group over the frozen V4.4 durable/search semantics. V5.0
first establishes correct replication under one configured leader. Later V5 minors
add automated leadership, explicit replica reads, membership operations and final
hardening. Sharding and distributed query are not V5 work.
